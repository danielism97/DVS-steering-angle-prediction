## Contents
### datasets
This folder contains all the data used for the classification part of the project, and the description of the data used for regression part.

### classification
1. **data processing**: scripts written in MATLAB and Python for downloading the dataset and event-to-frame conversion.
2. **training**: Jupyter notebooks containing code for creating and training models.
3. **models**: the final models trained on different types of frames.

### regression
1. **data processing**: Jupyter notebook used to load and process the data so as to get them ready for training.
2. **training**: contains the Jupyter notebook used to import data and train the models.
3. **models**: contains the models trained on both types of frames for three subsets individually.
